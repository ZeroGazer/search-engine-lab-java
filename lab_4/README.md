Requirements 

You should write a HTML file called lab4.html. It contains one text input box
for entering a list of words. The user is expected to separate each word by
space. For example, the user may type "information retrieval computer science".

You should write a JSP file named lab4.jsp. It gets the string in the input box
from the web page lab4.html. The program should divide it into a list of words,
and output it line by line on the browser.
