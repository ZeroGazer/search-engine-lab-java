Requirements 

You may notice that in the sample today, the stopword list is hard-coded by
inserting each word line by line. You are required to modify the example program
to read stopwords from a file, stopwords.txt.

You only need to modify the code in "StopStem" function, which is used to read
the stopwords from txt file into memory. You are not required to touch other
code in sample program. Thus, a package named as "IRUtilities" should be created
under project and Porter.java should be put under the package.

According to the sample code, "StopWords.txt" should be set the same directory
as "src" folder of the project. Learn by yourself about how to read external txt
file by "BufferedReader".
